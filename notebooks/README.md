# Notebooks
The notebooks follow the following order:

1. (1_directional_overview) Code for evaluating the direction in a seismic  3D survey. PCA, T-SNE, and UMAP is used to showcase how manifold learners percieves the directions.

2. (2_patch_and_standard_learners) Code for gridding a seismic survey up in patches with a certain size, and configurations, training, and result from all standards learners.

3. (3_vae_impementation) Configurations, training, and result from Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

4. (4_shortest_path) Code for calculating and showcasing the shortest path on the induces riemann geometry from the VAE.
