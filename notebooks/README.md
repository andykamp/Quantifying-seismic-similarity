The notebooks follow the following order:

01. 1_directional_overview

...Code for evaluating the direction in a seismic  3D survey. PCA, T-SNE, and UMAP is used to showcase how manifold learners percieves the directions.

02. 2_patch_and_standard_learners

...Code for gridding a seismic survey up in patches with a certain size, and configurations, training, and result from all standards learners.  

03. 3_vae_impementation

...Configurations, training, and result from all Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

04. 4_shortest_path

...Code for calculating and showcasing the shortest path on the induces riemann geometry from the VAE.
